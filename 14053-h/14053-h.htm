    <h2>THE AUTOMATIC PHYSIOGNOMIST.</h2>

    <blockquote>
        <p>SCENE&mdash;<i>The German Exhibition, near an ingenious
        machine constructed to reveal the character and future of a
        person according to the colour of his or her hair, for the
        small consideration of one penny. A party of
        Pleasure-seekers are examining it.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>First Pleasure-seeker</i> (<i>a sprightly young lady of
    the name of</i> LOTTIE). "Put in a penny and get a summary of
    your character from the colour of your 'air." I wonder what
    they'll 'ave <i>next</i>!</p>

    <p><i>Second Pl.-s.</i> (<i>her admirer, a porridge-faced young
    man with pink eyelids and faming hair, addressed as</i> 'ECTOR
    <i>by his intimates</i>). Ah, it's surprising how far they've
    got, it reelly is. And beginning with butter-scotch, too!</p>

    <p><i>Aunt Maria</i>. Come on, do&mdash;you don't want to waste
    no more time over that rubbidge!</p>

    <p><i>Fourth Pl.-s.</i> (<i>a lanky youth, with pale hair and a
    receding chin, to his fiancée</i>). Hadn't we better be making
    a move if we're going to 'ear the band, CARRIE?</p>

    <p><i>Carrie</i>. I shall move on when I <i>like</i>, without
    your leave, FREDDY; so make no mistake.</p>

    <p><i>Freddy</i>. Oh, <i>I</i>'m in no 'urry. I only thought
    your Aunt was getting&mdash;but don't mind me. [CARRIE <i>does
    not mind him.</i></p>

    <p><i>Dolph</i>. (<i>the funny man of the party</i>). 'Old on a
    bit! I've got some coppers. I'm going to sample this concern.
    I'll put in for all of you&mdash;it's <i>my</i> treat, this is.
    We'll begin with Aunt MARIA. What colour do you call
    <i>your</i> 'air now? I don't see any slot marked
    "cawfy-colour."</p>

    <p><i>Aunt Maria</i>. Never <i>you</i> mind what colour my 'air
    is&mdash;it's a pity you can't find a better use for your
    pennies.</p>

    <p><i>Dolph</i>. (<i>inserting a penny in a slot marked "Light
    Brown"</i>). 'Ere goes, the oracle's working. (<i>The machine
    emits a coloured card</i>.) Listen to what it says about Aunt
    MARIA. She is&mdash;"tender-'arted." Jest what I've always said
    of her! "A little 'asty in her temper"&mdash;'ullo, must be a
    'itch in the machinery, <i>there</i>!&mdash;"neither obstinate
    nor 'aughty"&mdash;(<i>A snort from</i> Aunt MARIA <i>at
    this</i>)&mdash;"her inclination to love never unreasonable."
    'Ow <i>like</i> her! "Frolicsome, inclined to flirt and
    sometimes mischievous." You <i>giddy</i> little thing! Up to
    all your little tricks, this machine is! "Fertile in
    imagination, domesticated, thoughtful and
    persevering"&mdash;There's Aunt MARIA for yer!</p>

    <p><i>General Chorus</i>. Good old Aunt MARIA!</p>

    <p><i>Dolph</i>. There's a prophecy on blue paper from
    <i>Napoleon's Book of Fate</i>, gratis. (<i>Reads.</i>) "Thy
    'oroscope forewarns thee of a loss if thou lendest thy money."
    Just when I was going to borrow arf-a-crown off of her too!</p>

    <p><i>Aunt Maria</i>. Ah, I didn't want no machine for
    <i>that</i>. 'Ow you can patronise such rubbidge, <i>I</i>
    don't know! Tellin' characters by the colour of your 'air,
    indeed&mdash;it's told <i>mine</i> all wrong, anyhow!</p>

    <p><i>Dolph</i>. Well, you see, your 'air's so natural it would
    deceive <i>any</i> machine! [<i>Movement on part of</i> Aunt
    MARIA.</p>

    <p><i>Lottie</i>. Put in for 'ECTOR next, DOLPH, do. I want to
    hear what it says about him.</p>

    <p><i>Dolph</i>. They don't keep <i>his</i> colour in
    stock&mdash;afraid o' losing their insurance policy. "Red or
    orbun's" the nearest they can get to it. (<i>He puts in a penny
    in the "Red" slot.</i>) Here's old 'ECTOR. (<i>Reads.</i>) "The
    Gentleman with long red hair is of a restless disposition,
    constantly roving." Keep your eye on him, LOTTIE! "Impatient
    and fiery in temper"&mdash;<i>'Old</i> 'im, two of
    yer?&mdash;"but for all that, is kind and loving." You
    <i>needn't</i> 'old him&mdash;it's all right. "He is
    passionately fond of the fair sex." What <i>all</i> of 'em,
    'ECTOR? I'm ashamed of yer! "He is inclined to
    timidity"&mdash;Oo'd ha' thought it?&mdash;"but by reflection
    may correct it and pass for a man of courage." You start
    reflecting at <i>once</i>, old chap!</p>

    <p><i>'Ector</i> (<i>ominously, to</i> LOTTIE). If DOLPH don't
    mind what he's about, he'll go too far some day!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>He breathes hard, then thinks better of it.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Dolph</i>. Now it's CARRIE's turn. "Leave you out?"
    Couldn't think of it. Brown 'air, CARRIE's is. (<i>He puts in a
    penny.</i>) "A Lady with 'air of a medium brown colour, long
    and smooth"&mdash;<i>Is</i> your 'air long though, CARRIE?</p>

    <p><i>Carrie</i> (<i>with pride</i>). I should hope so&mdash;I
    can set on it.</p>

    <p><i>Dolph</i>. That's nothing! So can Aunt MARIA set on
    <i>hers</i>! (<i>With a glance at that Lady's very candid
    "front."</i>) <i>Can't</i> you, Auntie, eh? If you make a
    effort?</p>

    <p><i>Aunt Maria</i> (<i>with dignity</i>). I'll thank you to
    'ave the goodness to drop your sauce, Mr. ADOLPHUS GAGGS; it's
    out of place and not appreciated, I can assure you! [<i>She
    walks away.</i></p>

    <p><i>Dolph</i>. (<i>surprised</i>). Why, there's Aunt MARIA
    got the 'ump&mdash;for a little thing like <i>that</i>! Let me
    finish with CARRIE. (<i>Reads.</i>) "She is of an intellectual
    turn of mind." (<i>"'Ear, 'ear!" from</i> FREDDY.) "Very fond
    of reading." Takes in <i>Sloper's 'Alf 'Oliday</i> regular!
    "Steadfast in her engagements." 'Ullo, CARRIE!</p>

    <p><i>Carrie</i> (<i>firing up</i>). Well, have you anything to
    say against that? You'd better take care, Mr. GAGGS!</p>

    <p><i>Dolph</i>. I was only thinking. Sure you haven't been
    squaring this machine? Ah, it tells you some 'ome truths
    here&mdash;"Although inquisitive and fond of prying into the
    secrets of others&mdash;" Now however did it know
    <i>that</i>?</p>

    <p><i>Carrie</i>. It isn't there&mdash;you're making it up!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>She snatches the card, reads it, and tears it
        up.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Dolph</i>. Temper&mdash;temper! Never mind. Now we'll try
    FREDDY. What's his shade of 'air? I should say about the colour
    of spoilt 'ay, if I was asked.</p>

    <p><i>Carrie</i> (<i>with temper</i>). You're <i>not</i> asked,
    so you needn't give your opinion!</p>

    <p><i>Dolph</i>. Well, keep <i>your</i> 'air on, my dear girl,
    and we'll call FREDDY's "Fair." (<i>Reading card.</i>) "A
    gentleman with this colour of hair will be assiduous in his
    occupation&mdash;"</p>

    <p><i>Carrie</i> (<i>warmly</i>). What a shame! I'm <i>sure</i>
    he isn't. <i>Are</i> you, FREDDY? [FREDDY <i>smiles
    vaguely.</i></p>

    <p><i>Dolph</i>. "Not given to rambling,"&mdash;Except in his
    'ed,&mdash;"very moderate in his amorous wishes, his mind much
    given to reflection, inclined to be 'asty-tempered, and, when
    aroused,"&mdash;'Ere, somebody, rouse FREDDY, quick!&mdash;"to
    use adjectives." Mustn't use 'em <i>'ere</i>, FREDDY! "But if
    reasonably dealt with, is soon appeased." Pat his 'ed, CARRIE,
    will yer? "Has plenty of bantering humour." (<i>Here</i> FREDDY
    <i>grins feebly.</i>) Don't he <i>look</i> it too! "Should
    study his diet." That means his grub, and he works 'ard enough
    at that! "He has a combination of good commercial talents,
    which, if directed according to the reflection of the
    sentiments, will make him tolerably well off in this world's
    goods."</p>

    <p><i>Carrie</i> (<i>puzzled</i>). What's it torking about
    <i>now</i>?</p>

    <p><i>Dolph</i>. Oh, it on'y means he's likely to do well in
    the cat's-meat line. Now for your fortune, FREDDY. "It will be
    through marriage that your future will be brightened."</p>

    <p><i>Carrie</i> (<i>pleased</i>). Lor, FREDDY, think o'
    that!</p>

    <p><i>Dolph</i>. Think <i>twice</i> of it, FREDDY, my boy. Now
    we'll be off and get a drink.</p>

    <p><i>Carrie</i>. Wait. We haven't got <i>your</i> character
    yet, Mr. GAGGS!</p>

    <p><i>Dolph</i>. Oh, mine&mdash;they couldn't give that for a
    penny. Too good, yer know!</p>

    <p><i>Carrie</i>. If they haven't got it, it's more likely
    they're afraid it would break the machine. I'm going to put in
    for you under "Black." (<i>She does.</i>) Here we are.
    (<i>Reads.</i>) "The gentleman will be much given to liquor."
    Found out first time, you see, Mr. GAGGS!</p>

    <p><i>Dolph</i>. (<i>annoyed</i>). Come, no personalities now.
    Drop all that!</p>

    <p><i>Carrie</i>. "Somewhat quarrelsome and of an unsettled
    temper; more decorous and less attentive in his undertakings,
    and consequently meets with many disappointments. Such
    gentlemen"&mdash;now you listen to this, Mr. GAGGS!&mdash;"will
    now know their weaknesses, which should induce them to take
    steps to improve themselves." (<i>"'Ear, 'ear!" from the rest
    of the party.</i>) "Knowledge is power, and enables us to
    overcome many obstacles we otherwise should have fallen prey
    to." This is your fortune. "Thou art warned to be careful what
    thou drinkest!" Well, they do seem to <i>know</i> you, I must
    say!</p>

    <p><i>Dolph</i>. (<i>in a white rage</i>). I tell you what it
    is, Miss CARRIE BICKERTON, you appear to me to be turning a
    'armless joke into a mejium for making nasty spiteful
    insinuations, and I, for one, am not going to put up with it,
    whatever others may! So, not being partial to being turned into
    redicule and made to look a fool in company, I'll leave you to
    spend the rest of the evening by yourselves, and wish you a
    very good-night!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>He turns majestically upon his heel and leaves the
        party stupefied.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>'Ector</i>. (<i>with mild regret</i>). It do seem a pity
    though, so pleasant as we were together, till this come up!</p>

    <p><i>Freddy</i>. And CARRIE's Aunt MARIA. gone off in a
    tantrum, too. We shall have a job to find <i>'er</i> now!</p>

    <p><i>Lottie and Carrie</i>. Oh, <i>do</i> hold your tongues,
    both of you. You and your automatic machines!</p>

    <p><i>'Ector and Freddy</i>. <i>Our</i> automatic machines!
    Why, we never&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Lottie and Carrie</i>. If you say one word more, either
    of you, we'll go home! [FREDDY <i>and</i> 'ECTOR <i>follow them
    meekly in search of</i> Aunt MARIA <i>as the Scene closes
    in.</i></p>

    <h2>A ROMANCE IN NUMBERS.</h2>

    <p>As we announced last week, the <i>Gentlewoman</i> proposes
    for publication "the most extraordinary novel of modern
    times"&mdash;a tale which is to be written chapter by chapter,
    week after week, by well-known writers of fiction, without
    consultation with their collaborateurs. We did the same thing
    years ago. However, as the notion is still calculated to amuse
    and instruct our readers, we subjoin a short story, which has
    been written on the same terms by the entire strength of a
    paper&mdash;political, sporting, and social. It will be found
    below.</p>

    <h3>WHAT? WHO? AND WHICH?</h3>

    <h4>(<i>A Joint Stock Mystery.</i>)</h4>

    <p><i>Political Writer commences</i>.&mdash;Yes, EUSTACE
    entered the House prepared to vote for the Government. He knew
    that Lady FLORA had counted upon his vote in support of her
    father, the Duke, and the other Members of the Opposition. But
    when did love outweigh duty? EUSTACE knew that the prosperity
    of the entire country depended upon his views. With the price
    of corn falling, with the Russian Bear on the prowl, growing
    nearer and nearer to our Afghan frontier, with the unsettled
    state of the South American Republics, he knew that only one
    course was open to him.</p>

    <p>"FLORA, darling," he said to the fair girl, as he paced by
    her side in the Lobby, "believe me, I will do anything to help
    you; but what <i>can</i> I do?"</p>

    <p><i>Sporting Writer continues</i>.&mdash;"What can you do?"
    she echoed, with a hearty laugh, as she struck her riding-habit
    smartly with her whip; "why, tell me the horse you fancy for
    the Cambridgeshire!"</p>

    <p>He thought for a moment. He knew the good points of
    <i>Bobby</i>, and was rather partial to <i>Rosina</i>; but
    nothing wrong with <i>Snuffbox</i>, the stable reports were
    favourable. Still, you can't always rely upon what you see,
    much less what you hear.</p>

    <p>"Lady," said he, at length, "if you take my advice, you will
    back nothing until they go to the post."</p>

    <p><i>Continuation by French Correspondent</i>.&mdash;They had
    no further time for parley, because the mail train left for
    Dover within the hour. So they hurried to Victoria, and in less
    than eight hours were in the Capital of the World.</p>

    <p>Ah, Paris, beautiful Paris! They enjoyed the balmy air as
    they drove through the awaking streets to the Grand Hotel. As
    they entered the courtyard they met the President.</p>

    <p>"Is it really true that the Germans refuse to take up the
    Russian Loan?" asked EUSTACE of the First Frenchman in
    France.</p>

    <p>"I would not say this to anyone but yourself," replied M.
    CARNOT, looking round to see that no one was listening; "but
    those who wait longest will see best!"</p>

    <p>And with his finger to his mouth in token of discretion and
    silence, he disappeared. EUSTACE and his fair companion
    hastened to the telegraph office.</p>

    <p><i>Scientific Writer takes it up</i>.&mdash;They were, of
    course, desirous of transmitting their important despatch to
    head-quarters.</p>

    <p>"You want to know upon what system the telephone is worked?"
    queried the operator, as he prepared a black-board, and took up
    a piece of chalk. They bowed acquiescence. "You must know,"
    said he, "that if we represent the motive-power by <i>x</i>, we
    shall&mdash;."</p>

    <p><i>Lady Correspondent turned on</i>.&mdash;Before he could
    complete his sentence, Lady FLORA uttered a cry.</p>

    <p>"What a charming gown! Why, it is the prettiest I have seen
    in my life!" and she gazed with increasing delight at the lady
    beneath on the boulevard. Then she began to explain the costume
    to her two male companions. She showed them that an under-skirt
    of snuff, with a waist of orange-blue, both made of some soft
    fluffy material (which can be obtained, by the way, at Messrs.
    SOWE AND SOWE), made an admirable contrast.</p>

    <p><i>Naval Correspondent puts finishing
    touch</i>.&mdash;[<i>Please end up
    briskly</i>.&mdash;ED.].&mdash;And they left Paris, and
    embarking on H.M.S. <i>Ramrod</i>, met a gale, and foundered.
    When they were picked up they were both dead.&mdash;[THE
    END.]</p>

    <h2>LETTERS TO ABSTRACTIONS.</h2>

    <h4>No. IV.&mdash;TO POMPOSITY.</h4>

    <p>YOUR EXCELLENCY,</p>

    <p>How difficult it is to succeed in giving pleasure. When I
    addressed you recently, I honestly intended to gratify you by
    the adoption of a tone of easy familiarity. Surely, I thought
    to myself, I cannot be wrong if I address my friend POMPOSITY
    by his name, and speak to him in a chatty rather than in an
    inflated style. If I chose the latter, might he not think that
    I was poking fun at him by cheap parody, and manifest his
    displeasure by bringing a host of BULMERS about my ears? These
    considerations prevailed with me, and the result was the letter
    you received. But, <i>O pectora cæca</i>! I have learnt from an
    authoritative source that you are displeased. You resent, it
    seems, what you are pleased to term my affectation of intimacy,
    and you beg for a style of greater respect in any future
    communications. So be it. I have pondered for hours, and have
    eventually come to the conclusion that I shall best consult
    your wishes by addressing you in a manner suited to diplomatic
    personages of importance. I have noticed that in their official
    intercourse these gentlemen move on stilts of the most rigid
    punctilio, and I have often pictured to myself the glow of
    genuine pride which must suffuse the soul of an ambassador or a
    foreign Minister when, for the first time, he finds himself
    styled an Excellency. It may be of course that he knows himself
    to be anything rather than excellent, but he will keep that
    knowledge to himself, stowed away in some remote corner of his
    mind, and never on any account allowed to interfere with his
    enjoyment of the ignorant and empty compliments that others pay
    him.</p>

             alt="Benjamin Chump." /></a>
    </div>

    <p>I wish to ask you a simple question. Why do you render those
    who spend their lives in your service so extremely ridiculous?
    That may be just the fashion of your humour; but is it fair to
    persist as you do? There is, for instance, my old friend
    BENJAMIN CHUMP, little BEN CHUMP as we used to call him in the
    irreverent days, before his face had turned purple or his
    waistcoat had prevented him from catching stray glimpses of his
    patent-leathered toes. Little BEN was not made for the country,
    that was certain. A life of Clubs and dinner-parties would have
    suited him to perfection. In his Club he could always pose
    before a select and, it must be added, a dwindling circle as a
    man of influence. "There is no Club, however watched and
    tended, but one dread bore is there." BEN might have developed
    into a prime bore, but as he was plentifully supplied with
    money and had a good cook and a pleasant wife, he would always
    have managed to gather round him plenty of guests who would
    have forgiven him his elaborate platitudes, for the sake of his
    admirable made-dishes. Suddenly, however, he resolved to become
    a country gentleman. As there is no law to prevent a CHUMP from
    turning into a squire, BEN had not to wait very long before he
    was able to put his fatal resolve into execution. He purchased
    an Elizabethan mansion, and descended with all his airs and
    belongings upon the unhappy country-side which he had decided
    to make the scene of his rural education. Before that I used to
    see him constantly. After that I quite lost sight of him.
    Occasionally I read paragraphs in weekly papers about immense
    festivities due to the enterprise of the CHUMPS, and from time
    to time I received local papers containing long accounts of
    hunt breakfasts, athletic sports, the roasting of whole oxen,
    and other such stirring country incidents in which it appeared
    that the CHUMPS took a prominent part. I will do BEN the credit
    to say that he never omitted to mark with broad red pencil
    those parts which referred specially to himself, or reported
    any speech he may have happened to make.</p>

    <p>Eventually that which I dreaded came about. Circumstances
    made it impossible for me to refuse an invitation to Carchester
    Manor, and on a certain evening in the first week of December I
    found myself a guest under the roof of the CHUMPS. The
    entertainment provided was, I am bound to say, magnificent.
    Every want that the most exacting guest could feel was supplied
    almost before he had expressed it, and all that gorgeous rooms,
    stately retainers and irreproachable cooking could do to secure
    our comfort was done at Carchester Manor. But CHUMP himself was
    on that first evening the grandest spectacle of all. He
    overpowered me. Like some huge Spanish galleon making her way
    with bellying sails and majestic progress amidst a fleet of
    cockle-shells, so did CHUMP bear himself amidst his party. The
    neighbouring magnates came to meet us. Lord and Lady AGINCOURT
    with their charming daughter Lady MABEL POICTIERS, Sir GEORGE
    BUCKWHEAT and his wife, the Reverend Canon and Mrs. CATSPAW,
    and a host of others were there to do CHUMP honour. I thought
    of POLYCRATES and his ring and of other well-known examples.
    Something I knew must happen to disturb this edifice of pompous
    grandeur. The something was not long in coming, for just after
    CHUMP had expatiated at immense length upon the vintages of
    France, after he had offered to stock the failing cellars of
    Lord AGINCOURT from his own, after the butler had, with due
    parade, placed two corks at his master's side in token of the
    treat that was to follow, it was discovered by little BILLY
    SILTZER, an impudent dog without veneration or reticence, that
    <i>both</i> the bottles of <i>Pontet Canet</i> were
    disgustingly corked. To my relief, but to CHUMP's discomfiture,
    BILLY announced his discovery. "BEN, my boy," he shouted across
    the table, "the moths have been at this tap of wine. I'm afraid
    his Lordship won't care to take it off your hands." BEN became
    blue with suppressed fury. The trembling butler obeyed his
    angry summons. "Take that stuff away," said BEN, "and drink it
    yourself. Bring fresh wine at once." But, alas, for wasted
    indignation, no more <i>Pontet Canet</i> was forthcoming, and
    we had to satisfy ourselves on a wine whose inferiority no
    flourish of trumpets could disguise.</p>

    <p>Now there is nothing in the accident of a corked bottle that
    ought to crush a man. I have seen a host rise serenely after
    such an occurrence, and nobody dreamt of imputing it to him for
    wickedness. But the contrast between the magniloquence of poor
    BEN and the deadly failure of his wine, was too great. Even
    Lady MABEL, a kind girl without affectations, could not forbear
    a smile when the incident was narrated to her in the
    drawing-room, and some of the other guests, whose names I
    charitably refrain from mentioning, seemed quite radiant with
    pleasure at the misfortune of their host. CHUMP, however, was
    not long in recovering, and before many hours had passed, he
    was assuring us in the smoking-room, that he proposed to
    establish sport in his particular district on a broad and
    enduring basis. On the following morning there was a lawn-meet
    at the Manor, and, as I'm a living sinner, our wretched host
    was flung flat on his back before the eyes of all the
    neighbouring sportsmen and sportswomen by a fiery chestnut
    which he bought for £400 from a well-known dealer. What became
    of him during the rest of the day I know not. Indeed I shrink
    from continuing the story of his ridiculous humiliations, and I
    merely desire to remark that if this be your Excellency's
    manner of rewarding those who serve you, I pray that I may be
    for ever preserved from your patronage.</p>

    <p>So much, then, for BENJAMIN. In spite of everything I have a
    sort of sneaking regard for the poor man, especially since I
    discovered that he was not a free agent, but was inspired in
    word and action by your blatant influence. Were it not that I
    feared to weary you, I might proceed at much greater length. I
    might parade before you regiment upon regiment of pompous local
    magnates and political nobodies all drilled and disciplined by
    your offensive methods, and all of them as absurd and
    preposterous as they can be made. But the spectacle would only
    move you to derision. One point, however, I must insist on.
    Whatever you do, don't throw JOSHUA POSER across my path again.
    I might do him an injury. We were at College together, he being
    my senior by a year. Even then he always assumed a
    condescension towards me, an air as of one who temporarily
    stepped down from a pedestal to mingle with common grovellers.
    He became a personage in the City, a Chairman and a Director of
    Companies, and I lost sight of him. Yesterday I met him, and he
    was good enough to address me. "Yes, yes," he observed, "I
    remember you well. I have read some of your contributions to
    periodical literature, and I can honestly say I was pleased;
    yes, I was pleased. Of course the work is unequal, and I marked
    one or two passages that might have been omitted with
    advantage. For instance, the discussion between the vicar and
    the family doctor is not quite in the most refined taste, but
    there is distinct promise even in that. By the way, why don't
    you write in <i>The New Congeries</i>? Your style would suit
    it. I always take that paper in, and I find it very much
    appreciated in the pantry. The butler reads it, when we have
    done with it, and passes it on to the footman. It keeps them
    out of mischief. Now take my advice, and contribute to that." I
    humbly murmured my thanks to this intolerable person, and left
    him. As I turned away I half thought I heard the sound of your
    Excellency's bellows in the neighbourhood of POSER. Was I
    wrong?</p>

    <h2>CHARLEMAGNE AND I.</h2>

    <p><i>Aix-la-Chapelle, Monday</i>.&mdash;CHARLEMAGNE was
    doubtless well advised in selecting this town for his
    residence. However that be, it is not a matter for us to
    dogmatise about. I have heard a lamented friend, suddenly and
    all too soon lost, say there are few things more regrettable
    than the tendency of the present age to review the actions of
    great men, not lost but gone before, and to pass judgment upon
    them without having enjoyed the opportunity of hearing what
    they might have to say in justification or palliation of the
    proceedings challenged.</p>

    <p>That is true and tersely put. Still I may observe that if C.
    lived at this period and had his choice, say between
    Aix-la-Chapelle and Homburg or Aix-les-Bains, it is doubtful
    whether he would have built his cathedral here. Unlike the two
    latter watering-places, Aix-la-Chapelle has other fish to boil
    besides the invalids who come hither attracted by the fame of
    its hot springs. It is a manufacturing town, and has all the
    characteristics of one. At Homburg or Aix-les-Bains you walk up
    a street, turn a corner and find yourself among pine-trees, or
    in a smiling valley with a blue lake blinking at the sun. Here
    the baths are in the centre of the town, and, like a certain
    starling, you feel you "can't get out."</p>

    <p>But invalids musn't be choosers, and if RUSTEM ROOSE sends
    you to Aix-la-Chapelle&mdash;he's always sending somebody
    somewhere&mdash;to la-Chapelle you must carry your Aix, in the
    hope that you may leave them there.</p>

    <p>"I wonder," said the Member for SARK, who as usual is
    grumbling round, "if the local female population was less
    unlovely in CHARLEMAGNE's time? Probably, since he married with
    a frequency not excelled by our HENRY VIII. But what was
    HILDEGARDE like&mdash;HILDEGARDE, his favourite spouse? If she
    in any way resembled the women who throng the streets of
    Aix-la-Chapelle to-day, C.'s lot was not a happy one. Never in
    any city, in either hemisphere, have I suffered such a
    nightmare of ugly ill-dressed women as is here found."</p>

    <p>That is a most unfair and unjustifiable remark to make.
    Brimstone evidently does not agree with SARK who is more
    disagreeable than ever. The only thing that has touched his
    stony nature since he came to Aix is the unselfish devotion of
    the local aristocracy to the interests of the town. Visitors
    mustering in the Elisengarten for their morning cups, notice
    the group of musicians in the orchestra by the entrance-gate.
    Every man wears a top-hat, the only head-gear of the kind seen
    in Aix. SARK, attracted by this peculiarity, made inquiries,
    and learned from an intelligent native that these are nobles in
    disguise, who, desirous of contributing to the common weal,
    turn out at seven every morning to play the band. They are
    willing to sink all social distinctions, save that they
    <i>will</i> wear the cylindrical hat of civilisation. Not
    comfortable, especially in wet weather; but it adds an air of
    distinction to the group.</p>

    <p>"Very nice of them," SARK grudgingly admits; "but"&mdash;he
    must have the compensation of a sneer&mdash;"imagine our House
    of Lords forming themselves into groups to play the band in
    Palace Yard, with HALSBURY wielding the mace by way of
    <i>bâton</i>! They'd never do it, TOBY, even in top-hats.
    Germany's miles ahead of us in this matter."</p>

    <p>Sorry to find Squire of MALWOOD, who spent a morning here on
    his way to Wiesbaden, agreeing in SARK's view of the standard
    of female beauty at Aix.</p>

    <p>"Strange," he mused, "that Nature never makes an ugly flower
    or tree or blade of grass; and yet, when it comes to men and
    women, behold!" and he swept a massive arm round the blighted
    scene in the crowded Kaiserplatz.</p>

    <p>A small boy who thought the beneficent stranger in blue
    serge was chucking pfennings about the Square, careered wildly
    round in search of the treasure. We walked on without
    undeceiving him. To quote again from an old friend: "There is
    nothing more conducive to the production and maintenance of a
    healthy mind in a sound body than enterprise and industry, even
    when, owing to misapprehension or miscalculation, their
    exercise leads to no immediate reward."</p>

    <p>It had been quite a surprise one morning to find the SQUIRE
    striding into the coffee-room at "Nuellens."</p>

    <p>"Thought you were down at Malwood," I said, "looking after
    your flocks and herds, your brocoli and your spring
    onions."</p>

    <p>"So I had hoped to be," he said, as we strolled up and down
    under the trees in the Elisengarten. "But the fact is, TOBY,
    dear boy, I could not stand the weather. I am of a sensitive
    nature, and it cut me to the heart to see cold winds nipping
    the fruit and trees, the flood of rain beating down the corn,
    the oats, and the mangel-wurzel. People make a mistake about
    me. They regard me as an ambitious politician, caring for
    nothing but the House of Commons and the world of politics. At
    heart I am an agriculturist. Give me three acres and a
    cow&mdash;anybody's, I don't care&mdash;and I will settle down
    in peace and quietness, remote from political strife, never
    turning an ear to listen to the roll of battle at Westminster.
    I am often distraught between the attractions of interludes in
    the lives of CINCINNATUS and of WILLIAM OF ORANGE's great
    Minister. Of the two I think I am more drawn towards the
    rose-garden at Sheen than by CINCINNATUS's unploughed land.
    Before I die I should like to create a new rose and call it
    'The Grand Old Man.'"</p>

    <p>Quite a revelation this of the true inwardness of the
    SQUIRE. Would astonish some people in London, I fancy, if ever
    I were to mention this conversation. But, to quote once more
    from a revered authority: "We all live a dual life, and are not
    actually that which, upon cursory regard, the passer-by
    believes us to be. Every gentleman, in whatever part of the
    House he may sit, has a skeleton in the cupboard of his
    valet."</p>

    <p>The SQUIRE stayed here only a morning, passing on to other
    scenes. I watched his departure with mingled feelings; sorrow
    at losing a delightful companion, and apprehension of what
    might happen if he were to remain here to go through the full
    cure. The place is, as SARK says, the most brimstony on the
    same level. You breathe brimstone, drink it, bathe in it, and
    take it in at the pores. At the end of three weeks or a month
    you are dangerously saturated with the chemical. An ordinary
    lucifer match is nothing to a full-bodied patient at the end of
    three weeks treatment at Aix-la-Chapelle. If the SQUIRE had
    stayed on, I should never have seen his towering frame pass
    underneath a doorway without my heart leaping to my mouth. Some
    day he would have accidentally struck his head against the
    lintel and would have ignited as sure as a gun.</p>

    <p>If CHARLEMAGNE were now alive, I feel certain from what I
    know of him, he would have exhausted the resources of
    civilisation in search of a preventive of this ever-present and
    dangerous risk. Under CAROLO MAGNO the patient might have gone
    about the streets of Aix-la-Chapelle with sweet carelessness,
    knowing that, however much brimstone he carried, he would
    strike only on the box.</p>

    <h2>AN ESSAY IN REVIEWING.</h2>

    <p>We are obliged to "Beginner" for the proffered contribution
    to our collection of Book Reviews. That is, however, a
    department of the paper our noble friend the BARON DE
    BOOK-WORMS reserves for his own pen. But as <i>Mr. Punch</i>
    has never been known to discourage beginners, he finds room
    here for the interesting contribution, which perhaps should
    more appropriately have been addressed to his <i>confrère</i>
    at the office of the <i>Athenæum</i>:&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Don Quixote</i>. By MIGUEL CERVANTES. We have
    conscientiously plodded through this voluminous work, which is
    certainly not entirely without merit. It purports to recount
    the daily doings of a resident in a village of La Mancha
    (Spain) who, accompanied by a clownish retainer, went forth in
    search of adventures. He was not very happy, his day's sport
    being invariably rounded oft by a sound drubbing, received
    either by himself, his Squire, or both. We wish Lord MACAULAY
    had lived to see the publication of this work, and had with
    fuller leisure relieved us of the task of reviewing it.
    Remembering his method of procedure as illustrated in his
    article on Dr. NARE's <i>Memoirs of Lord Burleigh</i>, he would
    doubtless by careful enumeration have been able to show that
    from first to last <i>Don Quixote</i> had more ribs broken than
    any man has actually possessed since ADAM was privy to a
    diminution of their original number. He seems also to have had
    a perpetual renewal of teeth, keeping pace with their frequent
    removal by brute force. As for the number of legs and arms he
    had fractured, MACAULAY's Schoolboy would have shrunk from the
    task of computing their aggregate.</p>

    <p>These are blemishes upon a work that is, at least, well
    intentioned, and which might have been more successful had our
    author been inclined to give his hero credit for more acumen.
    When he represents <i>Don Quixote</i> as running tilt at
    windmills under the impression that they are armed knights, and
    when he pictures him charging a flock of sheep in the belief
    that it is an ordered army, we think he too grossly trifles
    with the assumed credulity of his readers. Exaggeration is,
    indeed, the bane of a work that, from first page to last, bears
    evidence of the drawback of extreme youth on the part of the
    author. We have been pleased to notice some indications of
    humour in the conversation of <i>Sancho Panza</i>. But it is

    <p>BARON DE BOOK-WORMS owns to being easily affected by a
    pathetic episode. He well remembers how years ago in the course
    of a discussion among literary men about books and their
    writers, the Baron acknowledged that in spite of his having
    been told how the pathos of DICKENS was all a trick, and how
    the sentiment of that great novelist was for the most part
    false, he still felt a choking sensation in his throat and a
    natural inclination to blow his nose strenuously whenever he
    re-read the death of <i>Little Paul</i>, the death of
    <i>Dora</i>, and some passages about <i>Tiny Tim</i>. There was
    no dissentient voice as to the death of <i>Colonel Newcome</i>;
    all admitted the recurrence of that peculiar choking sensation,
    read they their THACKERAY never so often. Now the Baron differs
    from <i>Josh Sedley</i> in, as he thinks, many respects, but he
    is almost as "easily moved to tears" as was that stout hero.
    Wherefore this preface? Well, 'tis because the Baron owns to
    having "snivelled," if you will, when reading a delightful
    story, published by MACMILLAN in one volume ("bless all good
    stories in <i>one</i> vol., clearly printed!" says the Baron,
    parenthetically), entitled simply, <i>Tim</i>. No relation to
    <i>Tiny Tim</i> already mentioned; quite another child. The
    Baron strongly recommends <i>this</i> story, and especially to
    Etonians past and present, as giving a life-like picture which
    the latter will recognise, of the career at that great public
    school of a fragile little chap entirely unfitted by nature for
    the rough and tumble of such a life. The considerate tutor,
    too, is no effort of imagination; he exists; and, perhaps, such
    an one may have always existed since the division between
    Collegers and Oppidans first began. The Baron in his own time,
    nigh forty years ago, knew an exceptional species of this rare
    genus; but there are plenty of witnesses to the truth of the
    Etonian portion of <i>Tim</i>. "<i>Tolle, lege</i>!" quoth the
    Baron, and be not ashamed if in reading the latter portion of
    the story you have to search for your pocket-handkerchief, and,
    glancing furtively around, murmur to yourself, "But soft! I am
    observed!" Then when unobserved, "<i>wipe</i> the other eye!"
    and thank the unknown author of <i>Tim</i>; at the same time
    not forgetting your guide, philosopher, and friend,</p>

    <h2>THE G.P. AND THE G.P.O.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>A Dialogue strictly according to Precedent.</i>)</h4>

    <p><i>General Public</i>. I am sorry to say the condition of
    the Postal Service is really extremely defective. The delay in
    the delivery of letters is most annoying. Frequently a note
    which should be received in the evening is not obtained until
    the following morning&mdash;proof of this being given by the
    post-marks.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:24%;">
        <a href="images/191-2.png"><img width="100%"

    </div>

    <p><i>General Post Office</i>. Your complaint shall receive
    consideration.</p>

    <p><i>G.P.</i> You are most kind. Next, a telegram despatched
    from one part of London to another part, sometimes takes eight
    hours, and the reason given is that the counter-clerk has a
    discretionary power to retain telegrams until he has what he
    considers a sufficient supply for the messenger to take out for
    delivery. This naturally causes much delay and consequent
    inconvenience.</p>

    <p><i>G.P.O.</i> Your complaint shall receive
    consideration.</p>

    <p><i>G.P.</i> You are too good. Next, the carelessness at
    Branch Offices is extremely irritating. For instance, it is
    often the case that the words of telegrams have been altered
    and changed during transmission. It is unnecessary to point out
    that such mistakes are liable to create annoyance, not to say
    disaster.</p>

    <p><i>G.P.O.</i> Your complaint shall receive
    consideration.</p>

    <p><i>G.P.</i> Very many thanks. Then, at offices where females
    are engaged, rudeness is very common. Would-be purchasers of
    postage-stamps are frequently kept waiting while the clerks
    chatter to one another about matters entirely unconnected with
    the Department. And this habit is gaining ground in those
    offices in which male labour is only employed, especially in
    the immediate neighbourhood of St. Martin's-le-Grand itself. It
    is useless to call attention to this practice, as a simple
    denial from an official implicated is accepted by the
    authorities as proof (almost) positive of his or her
    innocence.</p>

    <p><i>G.P.O.</i> Your complaint shall receive
    consideration.</p>

    <p><i>G.P.</i> Again, thanks for your courtesy. But about these
    and many other grievances, the same stereotyped answer has
    invariably been received.</p>

    <p><i>G.P.O.</i> Your complaint shall receive
    consideration.</p>

    <p><i>G.P.</i> Exactly! That is the very answer. And it is felt
    that no other outcome will result from agitation. It seems
    utterly impossible to make the officials in charge realise
    their responsibility to the taxpayers.</p>

    <p><i>G.P.O.</i> Your complaint shall receive
    consideration.</p>

    <p><i>G.P.</i> Of course; the same parrot-cry! And it may be
    for years, and it be for ever, before reform is introduced. The
    probability is, that the present unsatisfactory condition of
    affairs may exist at St. Martin's-le-Grand until the hour of
    doom.</p>

    <p><i>G.P.O.</i> Your complaint shall receive
    consideration.</p>

    <p>The weather which, in Mr. DUNSTABLE's varied experience of
    five-and-twenty years, he assures me, has never been so bad,
    having at length afforded some indications of "breaking" I make
    the acquaintance, through Mrs. COBBLER, of Mr. WISTERWHISTLE,
    the Proprietor of the one Bath-chair available for the invalid
    of Torsington-on-Sea, who, like myself, stands in need of the
    salubrious air of that health-giving resort, but who is ordered
    by his medical adviser to secure it with the least possible
    expenditure of physical strength.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Both Mr. WISTERWHISTLE and his chair are peculiar in their
    respective ways, and each has a decided history. Mr.
    WISTERWHISTLE, growing confidential over his antecedents, says,
    "You see, Sir, I wasn't brought up to the Bath-chair business,
    so to speak, for I began in the Royal Navy, under His Majesty
    King WILLIAM THE FOURTH. Then I took to the Coast-Guard
    business, and having put by a matter of thirty pound odd, and
    hearing 'she' was in the market,"&mdash;Mr. WISTERWHISTLE
    always referred to his Bath-chair as "she," evidently regarding
    it from the nautical stand-point as of the feminine
    gender,&mdash;"and knowing, saving your presence, Sir, that old
    BLOXER, of whom I bought her, had such a good crop of cripples
    the last season or two, that he often touched two-and-forty
    shillings a-week with 'em, I dropped Her Majesty's Service, and
    took to this 'ere. But, Lor, Sir, the business ain't wot it
    wos. Things is changed woeful at Torsington since I took her
    up. Then from 9 o'clock, as you might say, to 6 P.M., every
    hour was took up; and, mind you, by real downright
    'aristocracy,'&mdash;real live noble-men, with gout on 'em, as
    thought nothink of a two hours' stretch, and didn't 'aggle,
    savin' your presence, over a extra sixpence for the job either
    way. But, bless you, wot's it come to now? Why, she might as
    well lay up in a dry dock arf the week, for wot's come of the
    downright genuine invalid, savin' your presence, blow'd if I
    knows. One can see, of course, Sir, in arf a jiffy, as you is
    touched in the legs with the rheumatics, or summat like it; but
    besides you and a old gent on crutches from Portland Buildings,
    there ain't no real invalid public 'ere at all, and one can't
    expect to make a livin' out of you two; for if you mean to do
    the thing ever so 'ansome, it ain't reasonable to expect you
    and the old gent I was a referring to, to stand seven hours a
    day goin' up and down the Esplanade between you, and you see
    even that at a bob an hour ain't no great shakes when you come
    to pay for 'ousing her and keepin' her lookin' spic and span,
    with all her brass knobs a shining and her leather apron fresh
    polished with patent carriage blackin': and Lor, Sir, you'd not
    b'lieve me if I was to tell you what a deal of show some
    parties expects for their one bob an hour. Why, it was only the
    other day that Lady GLUMPLEY (a old party with a front of black
    curls and yaller bows in her bonnet, as I dare say you've
    noticed me a haulin' up and down the Parade when the band's a
    playin'), says to me, says she, 'It ain't so much the easy
    goin' of your chair, Mr. WISTERWHISTLE, as makes me patronise
    it, as its general genteel appearance. For there's many a chair
    at Brighton that can't hold a candle to it!'" But at this point
    he was interrupted by the appearance of a dense crowd that half
    filled the street, and drew up in silent expectation opposite
    my front door. Dear me, I had quite forgotten I had sent for
    him. But the boy who cleans the boots and knives has returned,
    and brought with him <i>the One Policeman</i>!</p>

    rough work." Then he added, "By the way, what is the time?"</p>

    <p>"About half-past two, Sir," returned the other, and then, as
    his Captain made an unsuccessful grab, he muttered, "No you
    don't!"</p>

    <p>The ship in pursuit came on apace, and soon the two vessels
    were yard-arm to yard-arm engaged in mortal combat. For a while
    the confusion was so great that it was impossible to say what
    would be the upshot. But a fortunate torpedo sent the pirate
    craft to the bottom, and of all her crew, only the skipper
    survived. He was brought (loaded with chains) before his
    conqueror.</p>

    <p>"Well, you scoundrel," said the British Captain, "have you
    anything to urge in your defence before we prepare you for your
    execution?"</p>

    <p>"What would be the good?" was the sulky reply. "I know my
    fate."</p>

    <p>"That voice, those husky tones," exclaimed the epauletted
    representative of the English Admiralty; "surely I know them.
    They bring back painful recollections. Show your face,
    Sirrah!"</p>

    <p>"Why should I?" queried the conquered Chief. "It won't do me
    any good!"</p>

    <p>But at a gesture of the British Captain, his prisoner was
    seized, and his face forcibly washed.</p>

    <p>"What, BILLY TOMPKINS!" murmured the Briton, "and we meet
    again like this!"</p>

    <p>"Yes," answered the other, "and it can't be helped. You have
    your duty to perform, and so have I. Do your worst!"</p>

    <p>"But, BILLY, you were not always like this!"</p>

    <p>"No, JACK, I was not. Once I used to prattle at my mother's
    knee. I was beloved by my brothers and sisters, and I was the
    pride of the nursery!"</p>

    <p>And then the strong man broke down, and wept bitterly.</p>

    <p>"But have you not fallen very low?" asked the British
    Captain, gently.</p>

    <p>"Indeed I have! I am a thief, a liar, a scoundrel&mdash;and,
    in fact, a blackguard!"</p>

    <p>"With such surroundings," returned the Officer R.N.,
    pointing to the <i>debris</i> of the pirate craft, "it is
    difficult to dispute your contention. Indeed, you are a
    blackguard! But to what cause do you owe your fall?"</p>

    <p>"To my early training."</p>

    <p>"I do not comprehend you. Your early training! Where were
    you trained?"</p>

    <p>"In the <i>Britannia</i>!"</p>

    <p>And then the British Captain completely understood the
    situation.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
